# SOCIAL NETWORK
A basic social network. Find users, become friends and chat with them.

The goal of this project was to study React, Socket.io and Redux while creating a social network with features like friend request, bio editor, picture upload, chat, online users, search etc. This social network has just a learning and demo purpose.

I chose the topic of sharing secrets ;-)
